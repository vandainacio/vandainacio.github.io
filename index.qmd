## About me

I am a Reader (equivalent to an Associate Professor outside the UK) at the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh.

My research primarily focuses on biostatistics, particularly on the statistical evaluation of biomarkers and diagnostic tests. I work in both Bayesian and frequentist (nonparametric) statistics, with a stronger preference for the former.

My time is approximately equally split between research, teaching, and administration --- and I actually enjoy all three. My research may not --- or rather, will not--- change the world but I firmly believe that we can change lives through education that is free or, at the very least, accessible.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](files/cv_vanda.pdf).
